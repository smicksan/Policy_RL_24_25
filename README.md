## Introduction
This repository contains cleaned and pre-processed data for research on public environment and health policy in the Lombardy Region. 
Data was collected 17th of February 2025. The pre-processing steps outlined here explain how to download data from the BURL platform and prepare it for use with different classification models. The Jupyter notebook tutorials will be made available shortly. 
 
Text to sentence splitter using heuristic algorithm by Philipp Koehn and Josh Schroeder has been used and can be found here https://github.com/mediacloud/sentence-splitter/blob/develop/README.rst. 
The output format of the sentence splitted files, was csv and later transformed into Excel, the final data set in csv format can be found in the Dataset directory. 

## Dataset Description
40 public policies from the Regione Lombardia from the years 2012, 2013, and 2014 have been mined with a script from the following website: 
[Consultazione Burl](https://www.consultazioniburl.servizirl.it/ConsultazioneBurl/).

### **Policy Selection per Year**
- **2012:**
  - Sectors selected:
    - D.G. Sistemi verdi e paesaggio (1)
    - D.G. Sanita (1)
    - D.G. Ambiente, energia e reti (3)
  - Total: **5 policies**
- **2013:**
  - Sectors selected:
    - D.G. Sanita (6)
    - D.G. Ambiente, energia e reti (11)
  - Total: **15 policies**
- **2014:**
  - Sectors selected:
    - D.G. Sanita (2)
    - D.G. Ambiente, energia e reti (18)
  - Total: **20 policies**

## Preprocessing Steps
Create a folder in your directory and place the burlexport.sh script in the newly created directory. Run the script with the desired year and weeks. The files in pdf will automatically be downloaded in a new sub directory for each year. 
```bash
./burlexport.sh 2011 1 2 
```
the following script was executed in each folder containing the policies for each year:
```bash
./pdf2policy.sh
```
The reason for this script is that each PDF document with the indicated `pdf_id` contains multiple policies. 
The script helps separate policies that were not specifically targeted from the relevant sector policies.

The following script was used to transform the pdf chunked policies into .txt files for sentence splitting. 
```bash
./pdf2text.sh
```
### **Script Execution and Review**
- The script creates a new subfolder containing the chunked policies.
- The single files were manually reviewed to filter out policies that did not meet the targeted sector's requirements.
